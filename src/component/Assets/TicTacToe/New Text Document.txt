Tell me about yourself- name, edu, characteristics/strength, a little about project, ambition/aspiration, role model(if any), etc.

I am Karthik, a resident of Chennai. I successfully completed my higher secondary education in 2022 at ALM Matriculation Higher Secondary School, achieving a score of 423 out of 600 in Mathematics & Computer Science in the 12th standard. Regarding my abilities, I pride myself on being a proficient communicator, a good researcher, a good collabrator and a decisive decision-maker.

I have undertaken a project named "Todo Marker," a website designed to enable users to create tasks and assign them to others for completion in their daily lives. This initiative reflects my proficiency in various programming languages, including Java, Servlet, JSP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which were utilized in the development of this website.


I've always dreamed of wearing multiple hats - being a successful entrepreneur, a skilled front-end developer, and nurturing my deep love for football. Growing up, I didn't necessarily have specific role models, but I've held onto certain values. These principles have been my compass, guiding me to lead an ethical and responsible life on this planet.





One thing you enjoyed learning during your academy days?

During my time at the academy, learning HTML and CSS turned out to be the most enjoyable days for me. Initially, I had doubts about my ability to create a website. However, as I got curious into HTML and CSS, I successfully coded my first project, which I named "NFtguru." This achievement became one of my most cherished moments at the academy.





-Why Freshworks?

I found out about Freshworks being a software-based company through my uncle, who used to work there. Later, I had the chance to apply for the Freshworks Software Academy and got a glimpse of the company's work culture. I was really struck by how open and friendly everyone was with each other.

During my time at the Academy, I learned about the CHAT philosophy: Craftsmanship, Happy Work Environment, Agility with Accountability, and True Friend of the Customer. These four words made a real impact on me. 

How are you a culture fit in fresh works?

 as I mentioned I am a good communicator and a good collaborator. This chat philosophy was the one key thing that gave me confidence. It made me realize that I want to develop my skills in such a positive and accountable environment, just like what Freshworks stands for. This the work culture i wanted to work in.hn

One challenge you faced and how did you overcome that?

The biggest challenge for me is to manage my time and prioritize the tasks according to the priority. So I usually make a schedule after I wake up. And I'll reach out to my teachers/mentors to clarify the priority of the tasks. So this had a big impact on my day-to-day learning skills. I am able to spend more time learning new things.
